      <h1>Why Dont You Like Me</h1>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        The pain of rejection is often tied to the way that we interpret how another person thinks
        or feels about us. In this review, we explore evidence from the current literature to
        examine the role of mentalizing, the process by which we think about and understand
        someone else’s thoughts and feelings, in the experience of social rejection. We first turn
        to meta-analyses investigating the neural bases of social rejection to examine whether
        parts of the mentalizing network are also active during the experience of rejection
        (Cacioppo et al., 2013; Vijayakumar, Cheng, & Pfeifer, 2017). Next, we review some
        evidence suggesting that developmental changes in mentalizing, such as those during
        early childhood and adolescence, may be associated with changes in sensitivity to
        rejection (e.g. Somerville, 2013; Rochat, 2003). Then, we examine the extent to which
        individuals who demonstrate compromised mentalizing, such as those with schizophrenia
        or autism, may exhibit reduced sensitivity to rejection (e.g. Bauminger & Kasari, 2000;
        Gradin et al., 2012). Finally, we summarize some future directions building on the
        possibility of a link between mentalizing and the experience of social rejection. The
        available evidence seems to support a role of the mentalizing network in feeling the pain
        of social rejection, such that understanding another person’s mental state may be what
        allows us to understand and process rejection.
