      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>
        The abilities to perceive, understand, and manage emotions are essential to navigating the social world. But the social world also plays a critical role in shaping how we perceive, understand, and manage our emotions. How and why do we regulate our emotions? How are these processes influenced by our social environment and interactions? My research examines questions about emotion and emotion regulation, social cognition and behavior, and interactions between emotion and cognition.
