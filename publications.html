          <p class="abstract">
            Recently, the view that anger is bad, even wrong, to feel and express has gained popularity. Philosophers like Martha Nussbaum and Derk Pereboom posit that anger is fundamentally tied to a desire for retribution (i.e. getting even for past events), which they argue is immoral, counterproductive, and irrational. <span class="hidden">Thus, they argue, we should try our best to stop ourselves from feeling and expressing anger whenever it arises. I argue that anger is not inherently retributive, and that feeling and expressing anger are sometimes the most adaptive response to unfairness in one’s environment. I draw on robust psychological literature to characterize the dangers of over-regulating anger in terms of the practical, psychological, and humanitarian costs associated with not feeling and expressing anger. In the appropriate contexts, anger is crucial to prepare people to communicate disapproval, motivate necessary confrontation, and change wrongdoers’ harmful behaviors. Thus, the functions of anger are not focused on getting even for past events, but rather on protecting individuals from future harm. Importantly, the over-regulation of anger is likely to cause the most harm to individuals and communities that experience routine unfairness, thereby reinforcing social injustices. By adopting a functionalist perspective of emotions, we can shift our focus away from policing experiences of anger and towards enhancing its functional qualities through thoughtful reflection on the sources of peoples’ anger and resolutions for that anger.</span>

          <p class="abstract">
            Decades of research has pointed to emotion regulation (ER) as a critical ingredient for health, well-being, and social functioning. However, the vast majority of this research has examined emotion regulation in a social vacuum, despite the fact that in everyday life individuals frequently regulate their emotions with help from other people. <span class="hidden">The present collection of pre-registered studies examined whether social help increases the efficacy of reappraisal, a widely-studied ER strategy that involves changing how one thinks about emotional stimuli. In Study 1 (N = 40 friend pairs), we compared the efficacy of reinterpreting the content of negative stimuli alone (independent ER) to listening to a friend reinterpret the stimuli (social ER). We found that social ER was more effective than independent ER, and that the efficacy of these strategies was correlated within individuals. In Studies 2 and 3, we replicated effects from Study 1, and additionally tested alternate explanations for our findings. In Study 2 (N = 40 individuals), we ruled out the possibility that social ER was more effective than independent ER due to a difference in the quality of reinterpretations, and in Study 3 (N = 40 friend pairs), we found that social help did not attenuate negative affect in the absence of reappraisal. In sum, we found that social help selectively potentiates the efficacy of reappraisal, and that this effect was not merely the outcome of social buffering. Together, these results provide insight into how social relationships can directly lend a hand in implementing ER strategies.</span>

          <p class="pub-journal">The Neural Basis of Mentalizing - A Social-Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Perspective (M. Gilead & K.N. Ochsner)</p>
          <p class="abstract">
            The pain of rejection is often tied to the way that we interpret how another person thinks
            or feels about us. In this review, we explore evidence from the current literature to
            examine the role of mentalizing, the process by which we think about and understand
            someone else’s thoughts and feelings, in the experience of social rejection. <span class="hidden">We first turn
            to meta-analyses investigating the neural bases of social rejection to examine whether
            parts of the mentalizing network are also active during the experience of rejection
            (Cacioppo et al., 2013; Vijayakumar, Cheng, & Pfeifer, 2017). Next, we review some
            evidence suggesting that developmental changes in mentalizing, such as those during
            early childhood and adolescence, may be associated with changes in sensitivity to
            rejection (e.g. Somerville, 2013; Rochat, 2003). Then, we examine the extent to which
            individuals who demonstrate compromised mentalizing, such as those with schizophrenia
            or autism, may exhibit reduced sensitivity to rejection (e.g. Bauminger & Kasari, 2000;
            Gradin et al., 2012). Finally, we summarize some future directions building on the
            possibility of a link between mentalizing and the experience of social rejection. The
            available evidence seems to support a role of the mentalizing network in feeling the pain
            of social rejection, such that understanding another person’s mental state may be what
            allows us to understand and process rejection.</span>

          <p class="abstract">
            Cognitive reappraisal is among the most effective and well-studied emotion regulation strategies humans have at their disposal. Here, in 250 healthy adults across 2 preregistered studies, we examined whether reappraisal capacity (the ability to reappraise) and tendency (the propensity to reappraise) differentially relate to perceived stress. <span class="hidden">We also investigated whether cognitive flexibility, a skill thought to support reappraisal, accounted for associations between reappraisal capacity and tendency and perceived stress but found no evidence for this hypothesis. Both Studies 1 and 2 robustly showed that reappraisal tendency was associated with perceived stress, whereas a significant relationship between reappraisal capacity and perceived stress was only observed in Study 2. Further, Study 2 suggested that self-reported beliefs about one's emotion regulation capacity and tendency were predictive of wellbeing, whereas no such associations were observed with performance-based assessments of capacity and tendency. These data suggest that self-reported perceptions of reappraisal skills may be more predictive of wellbeing than actual reappraisal skills.
